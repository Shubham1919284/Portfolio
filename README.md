🔮 Future Enhancements
Project Filtering & Categories – Add filters so visitors can browse projects by domain (Data Science, Machine Learning, Analytics, Web Apps).

Interactive Case Studies – Embed live Power BI dashboards or Streamlit apps directly into the site so visitors can explore data instead of just seeing screenshots.

AI-powered Portfolio Guide – Add a small chatbot that answers FAQs about your skills, projects, and resume (could be powered by OpenAI/Azure API).

Downloadable Case Studies – Add PDF exports of detailed reports (like your Airlines & Fitness dashboards) so recruiters can download them directly.

Portfolio Analytics – Track engagement (which project links get clicked most, how long visitors stay) using Google Analytics or a privacy-friendly tool like Plausible.

Add a dark mode toggle
